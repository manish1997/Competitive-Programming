# TopCoder-
As of now I am solving DP problems from TC to get good understanding of it. So there may be many contests folders as I use Greed as plugin to my TC workspace but problems are of DP (div1 250, because many people have written here and there) only. Also most of the time I am solving only DIV-I 250 for the time being. So you will only find solutions for DIV-I 250. I will update readme when I start solving further. :)

Ignore following part of the code in every problem:
<br /><br />
// CUT begin<br />
/*<br />
Code to be ignored<br />
*/<br />
// CUT end<br />
